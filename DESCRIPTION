Description: This package contains the exact signed, HAC-corrected signed, signed rank and point-optimal sign-based tests of Professor. Jean-Marie Dufour and his coauthors. The tests are distribution-free and robust against heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Moreover, within a predictive regression framework, the tests of Campbell and Dufour (1995, 1997) are valid (control size for any given sample size), in the presence of highly persistent/endogeneous regressors.
